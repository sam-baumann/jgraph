# NHL shot selection visualizer
### This project is meant to help visualize NHL shot selection for an individual player in an individual game
### Written for Dr. James Plank's Advanced Programming and Algorithms class fall 2021

I've chosen to write this in Python because of my familiarity with it and easy access to a web requests api, and simple packages to parse the JSON that is returned by the NHL API.

Written in python 3.8.10 but should work for any python 3 version. Required libraries are: json, requests. Use pip to install these like so:

`python -m pip install [package_name]`
